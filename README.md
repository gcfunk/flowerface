An app created with PhoneGap http://phonegap.com/

For now, working on android, ios, and browser platforms

# Getting Started

http://phonegap.com/install/

I didn't actually create the app with the phone gap command.  I did that with the cordova command (See http://docs.phonegap.com/en/edge/guide_cli_index.md.html#The%20Command-Line%20Interface)
